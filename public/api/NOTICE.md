# Provider-Header Templates (`/src/api/`)

This directory bundles example “provider header” files that **StructOut Designer**
consumes when you pick a provider in the _Generated Schema_ pane.
Each file is a self-contained JSON object:

| File name              | Purpose                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **openai.json**        | Canonical header used to generate JSON Schema for OpenAI Chat Completions with the _json-schema_ tool. |
| **perplexity.json**    | Header tuned for Perplexity’s `/market/uploadperplexity/` endpoint.                                    |
| **google-gemini.json** | Minimal header for Google Gemini function-calling style.                                               |
| **anthropic.json**     | Header for Anthropic Claude’s `input_schema` convention.                                               |

The keys you will see:

- `provider`  Human-readable provider name
- `apiKey`   **Placeholder** (`x123456789`) — _never_ a real credential
- `genAIURLPathParameter` Example upload path to illustrate routing
- `llmSchemaHeader` Array of rule objects that the app merges with your field definitions to produce a provider-specific JSON Schema

All **API keys are dummies**; replace them in your own copy.
